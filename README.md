# Google Assistant Fan

This is a project I built 5 years ago, when I was 13 years old!

## What does it do?
Pretty simple! I connected a Raspberry Pi to my fan, and connected that to Google Assistant.

## How did I do it?
I bought a few relay switches and took apart my fan so that each wire went to a relay switch, which I connected to GPIO pins on my Raspberry Pi. I accidentally zapped myself once or twice with 120V, but it was worth it in the end!

(Yes, this was me as a kid)
